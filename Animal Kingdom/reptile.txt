Their bodies are covered with keratin feathers. Hairs are effective in flying and isolation of the body. Its front members differed in the form of wings. Most bones are hollow. 
This makes the skeleton lighter. They make lung breathing. There are air sacs attached to their lungs and these sacs extend into the bones that are hollow. The presence of air pouches facilitates flying.
They have beaks and no teeth in their mouths.

Their hearts are four rooms. Dirty and clean blood does not mix in the heart, and dirty and clean blood circulates separately in the body.
