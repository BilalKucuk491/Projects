
Features of Two-Lives

These creatures are called bivores because they adapt to living on raw land and in water.

They live in moist and close to water areas.

They make gills in larvae periods, lung and skin respiration in adulthood. The lungs are simple pouches.

Their hearts have 3 rooms. Dirty blood from the body and blood cleaned in the respiratory organ are mixed in the heart. Therefore, mixed blood circulates in their bodies. They are cold-blooded (variable body temperature) creatures. 

They hibernate.

Their skin has glands that secrete mucus. For this reason, their skin is always moist and slippery.
