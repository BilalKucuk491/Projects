It is the simplest group of the animal kingdom.

-It has no advanced systems.

- They live motionless in fresh waters and seas connected to the ground.

- As water passes through the holes (por) in their bodies, gas exchange, nutrient intake and waste are disposed.

- There is an inner skeleton (spikul) made up of silicon oxide and calcium carbonate crystals.

- Sponges can reproduce by sex and asexual (budding and regeneration), and have high self-renewal abilities. They are hermaphrodite. However, since gametes are produced at different times, they cannot fertilize themselves.
