
Features of Fish

They have about 24 000 species among the vertebrates. They are living in water. Internal skeletons can be of bone or cartilage structure. They make gill breathing. They are examined in three groups.


a-) Jawless fish
Unlike other vertebrates, it has no jaws. It has no teeth and its mouths have turned into a round-shaped absorbent structure. They have a soft body without scales. These parasitic creatures adhere to other fish with their sucking mouths and absorb their blood and body fluids. Petromizon is examined in this group.

b-) Cartilaginous fishes
Internal skeletons are completely made of cartilage, bone tissue is absent. Their skin is covered with scales. It has a pair of gills. There are no swimming pouches. They live in salt water. They feed on fish, seals, plankton and invertebrates.
They reproduce sexually. Fertilization takes place inside the body (internal fertilization). Some lay their eggs in water (external development) while others give birth to their offspring (internal development). Shark and stingray fish are examined in this group.

c-) bony fishes
They are fish with a skeleton, swimming sacs and scales made of bone. Swimming pouches are mostly structures located in the ridge and provide the creature to remain at a certain level on the water.
Their hearts are two rooms. Dirty blood, which is recovered from the body and from the heart, is pumped into the gills. Since the blood cleaned in the gills is pumped directly to the body without getting to the heart, while these creatures always have dirty blood in the heart, clean blood circulates throughout the body. Most of them have external fertilization and external development. In some species, internal fertilization is observed and offspring are born with birth.
