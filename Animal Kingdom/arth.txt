
Features of Arthropod

It includes crustaceans, spiders, multi-legged and insects.

- Their bodies are divided, and their organs are jointed.

- It has exoskeletons made of protein and kit. Arthropods can be herbivores, carnivores or omnivores.

Most of the breathing takes place with trachea, spider lungs, and aquatic gills.

-It has specialized excretory organs. It has an advanced nervous system.

Sense organs, especially eyes, are well developed. In some, the wings have developed and can fly. They reproduce and reproduce, often leaving eggs. Organisms hatching from eggs hatch during their developmental stages.

a. Crustaceans:

Their shells are hard. Most of them live in freshwater and sea, some live in humid areas of land. They make gill breathing. Examples of this group are lobster, crab, shrimp, crayfish, water flea.

b. Spiders, scorpions, ticks:

Almost all of them are land animals. It is distinguished from other arthropods in appearance by carrying four pairs of legs. The head and chest are fused together. Water ticks, spiders, ticks, mites and scorpions are examples of this group.

c. Many feet:

Their bodies are long and divided. There are feet in each compartment. There are a pair of feet in each chamber, and two pairs of feet in the centipede. Example: Centipede.
 
 
d. Insects: Their bodies consist of three parts: head, chest and abdomen.

- They have an open circulatory system and make trachea breathing.

- There is no respiratory gases and respiratory pigments in their blood.

They usually reproduce sexually and undergo transfiguration during their development. (Caterpillar turning into a butterfly)

Internal fertilization and external development are seen.

There is a pair of antennas in the head area.

They usually have two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs.

- The kit has an outer skeleton. Because the exoskeleton limits body growth, it is periodically replaced in insects.

- They have an open circulatory system.

-The discharge organ (malpighi tubes) prevents the loss of water from the body since it provides a dry waste. Urinary waste is uric acid.

Animals such as ants, bees, grasshoppers, lice, fleas, flies and termites can be given as examples.
