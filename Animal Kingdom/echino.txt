All of them live in the seas.

- Inside their bodies are an internal skeleton consisting of limestone plaques. There are spiny bumps on the inner skeleton. Therefore, its skin is called thorns.

-The regeneration abilities are high, that is, they can renew any part of their body that is broken off by cell division. It is at the level of asexual reproduction. For example, starfish can renew its broken arms and increase the number of individuals.

They reproduce asexual (regeneration) and sexual.

The bodies of the skin thorns may have five arms, as in starfish, or spheres, as in sea urchins, and cylinders, as in sea cucumbers.
